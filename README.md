# rollercoasters

Using Kaggle's Rollercoasters dataset, which contains information on the winners of the Golden Ticket Award for best steel rollercoaster, I've created a visual guide to help fellow thrill seekers pick their next ride. With over 1,000 rollercoasters to choose from, there's something for everyone, whether you identify as a scaredy cat, middle-of-the-pack rider, or ultimate daredevil. For each metric, I've highlighted a rollercoaster or park that best suits each thrill-seeking level. Personally, I'm trying to get to Ferrari World!

This project was built using p5.js.
